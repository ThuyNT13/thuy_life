[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ThuyNT13/thuy_life.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ThuyNT13/thuy_life)

This is an on-going project for which I will be documenting in great detail here: [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ThuyNT13/thuy_life/wiki).

The first iteration of the website project is static with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The design is responsive, and adjusts to any media screen and content is over **HTTPS** so it's secure. Will redo the CSS as working with **React** broke the it which opened up the possiblity of exploring different designs including getting rid of the [hamburger icon](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/) The current iteration was deployed using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and you can see it here: https://thuy.li

Pivoted on setting up the back-end now that I've been playing with front-end frameworks. **Rails** and **React** together seemed like a clashing of paradigms and I couldn't wrap my head around it so moved towards a **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) where the MVC made more logical sense. 

I presently have Travis CI setup with no tests, but as I build up the backend, I will probably add them.
