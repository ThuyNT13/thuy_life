[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ThuyNT13/thuy_life.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ThuyNT13/thuy_life)

This is an on-going project for which I will be documenting in great detail here: [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ThuyNT13/thuy_life/wiki).

The first iteration of the website project is static with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The design is responsive, and adjusts to any media screen and content is over **HTTPS** so it's secure. Some minor design issues but at the moment, the focus is now on tackling the back-end. The current iteration was deployed using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and you can see it here: https://thuy.life.

The next step will be to build up the backend in Rails and eventually deploy a dynamic website. Currently reading through **AWS** documentation and researching my options for how to best deploy [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/about/)  with [**Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) instances**](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/).

I presently have Travis CI setup with no tests, but as I build up the backend, I will probably incorporate MiniTests to test Ruby.
