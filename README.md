This is an on-going project for which I will be documenting in great detail here: [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ThuyNT13/thuy_life/wiki).

The first iteration of the website project is static with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The design is responsive, and adjusts to any media screen and content is over **HTTPS** so it's secure. It was deployed using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and you can see it here: https://thuy.life

The next step will be to build up the backend in Rails and eventually deploy a dynamic website.
