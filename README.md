[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ThuyNT13/thuy_life.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ThuyNT13/thuy_life)

This is an on-going project for which I will be documenting in great detail here: [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ThuyNT13/thuy_life/wiki).

The first iteration of the website project is static with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The design is responsive, and adjusts to any media screen and content is over **HTTPS** so it's secure.

Will redo the CSS as working with **React** broke it which opened up the possiblity of exploring different designs including getting rid of the [hamburger icon](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/).

The current iteration was deployed using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as can be seen here: https://thuy.life. In process of looking up [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) as others have recommended it would be a good way to deploy.

I presently have Travis CI setup with no tests, but as I build up the backend, I will probably add them.
