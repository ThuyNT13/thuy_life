[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ThuyNT13/thuy_life.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ThuyNT13/thuy_life)

This is an on-going project for which I will be documenting in great detail here: [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ThuyNT13/thuy_life/wiki).

The first iteration of the website project is static with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are some design issues, such as the illegibile text over background image, but the design is responsive, and adjusts to any media screen and content is over **HTTPS** so it's secure. It was deployed using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and you can see it here: https://thuy.life

The next step will be to build up the backend in Rails and eventually deploy a dynamic website.

I presently have Travis CI setup with no tests, but as I build up the backend, I will probably incorporate MiniTests instead of RSPEC to test Ruby.
